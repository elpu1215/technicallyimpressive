## Project Plan

For our project managment system, we are going to use Trello.
We have 5 columns for tracking and organizing our project progress: requirements (project backlog), planning, todo, in progress, and done.

* The requirements column simply lists all of our requirements and features we want for the project.
* For the planning column, we will simple drag features from the requirements to plan out the features we would like to work on in the next sprint.
* Once a sprint has started, we will move over all the tasks from the sprint plannig over to the todo as features that have not yet been completed.
* The in progress column holds all the features we are working on at the current time.
* Once a feature is completed, we will move it over to the finished column

We have categorized our features using Trello's label system into priorities from a scale of 1 to 3, with 1 being highest priority and 3 being lowest priority,
and functional vs non-functional. 
Clicking on a card gives a further description of what the feature needs as well as its complexity and who is assigned to the task.
Our aim is to do all of priority 1 by the end of the first sprint and all priority 2 requirements by the end of the second sprint.
In total, we plan on having 2 full 3 week sprints for the essential features and 1 shorter sprint towards the end of the semester for any extra features and/or polish.

## Group meeting description

Our second group meeting took place after we chose the idea for our project. We met at a table in the engineering center commons and brainstormed whether we wanted to make an Android app or website for the idea. We also went over the different coding experience each of us have, in order to get a better idea of how complex our project should be. After collaboration and compromise, we decided to make a website (since it would be less steep of a learning curve) that uses Python with Flask and SQLAlchemy to handle the backend and database. We chose this based on the fact that Justin has some experience doing Python/Flask and the rest of us had rudimentary knowledge of HTML/CSS. We closed our meeting by discussing our schedules for the following week and deciding what meeting times would be best to continue work on the project.
